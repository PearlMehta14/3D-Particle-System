## ✨ Key Features
- **Neural Link Tracking:** High-performance AI hand tracking using MediaPipe.
- **Dynamic Morphing:** Smooth GPU-accelerated transitions between templates (Saturn, DNA, Heart, Vortex, Nebula).
- **Hybrid Interaction:** Seamless automatic fallback to Mouse & Keyboard if no camera is detected.
- **Custom Intro:** A welcoming "HELLO" particle sequence on startup.
- **Rich Aesthetics:** Glassmorphic UI, vibrant color palettes, and responsive design.

## 🎮 How to Interact

### 🖐️ AI Gesture Controls

- **Closed Fist:** Activate the **Gravity Well** (suck particles into the center).
- **Two Fingers:** Trigger the secret **"I MISS YOU"** mode.
- **Finger Pinch:** Fine-tuned scaling.
- **Palm Position:** Particles follow your hand in 3D space.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Three.js** - 3D WebGL rendering.
- **MediaPipe** - Real-time hand landmark detection.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Core logic.
- **CSS3** - Premium glassmorphic UI styling.

## 🛠️ Local Setup
